## Gallery react native CLI

Implement a gallery based on React-Native (not React.js) that will display photos from unsplash. This application must retrieve the resource in JSON format.
REST API Documentation:
[unsplash com/documentation]



The application must contain two screens (pages):
* List
- mini image with title and author
- when the user clicks on the image, the photo screen opens
* Photo
- displays one photo with the maximum area.

It is preferable to initiate the application through the React Native CLI with the -react-native init TestApp command rather than with the -create-react-native-app command if your computer's resources allow.
